# Installation

1. If you don't already have a script manager installed:   
For Firefox install [Greasemonkey](https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/greasemonkey/), and for Chrome install [Tampermonkey](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/tampermonkey/dhdgffkkebhmkfjojejmpbldmpobfkfo). 
2. Click on the filename (Letterboxd_Search_Bars.user.js), wait for the new page to load, then click on the **Raw** button.
3. Your script manager will ask for permission to install the script.

# Usage

When on a film's page, simply click on one of the icons and you will be directed to a search for the film on the icon's website.


# Help

I've tested with Greasemonkey on Firefox, but **not** with Tampermonkey on Chrome. It should work with both but if YOU do run into any problems please let me know by opening a new Issue.
