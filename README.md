# [The Pirate Bay Tweaks](https://github.com/LeLobster/userscripts/tree/master/The_Pirate_Bay_Tweaks)

A script for The Pirate Bay which allows you to hide unwanted torrents, hide (or warn about) potential fakes based on some basic logic, add highlights so you can easily distinguish between different types of releases, and highlight your favorite uploaders.
This script is a fork of a [script by nicobelic](https://greasyfork.org/scripts/21980).

//TODO: UPLOAD SCRIPT TO GREASYFORK  
// ADD GREASYFORK LINK HERE IN THE README  
// SET UP A WEBHOOK  

This script can also be found at [Greasyfork]().
