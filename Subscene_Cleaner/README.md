# Installation

1. If you don't already have a script manager installed:   
For Firefox install [Greasemonkey](https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/greasemonkey/), and for Chrome install [Tampermonkey](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/tampermonkey/dhdgffkkebhmkfjojejmpbldmpobfkfo). 
2. Click on the filename (Subscene_Cleaner.user.js), wait for the new page to load, then click on the **Raw** button.
3. Your script manager will ask for permission to install the script.

# Usage

Good uploaders can be defined in `goodUploaders` *Example* = `['GoldenBeard', 'Luis-subs'];`  
Languages you want to keep can be defined in `keepLangs` *Example* = `['english']`

Then simply search for a movie on subscene and you can see the script working.


# Help

I've tested with Greasemonkey on Firefox, but **not** with Tampermonkey on Chrome. It should work with both but if YOU do run into any problems please let me know by opening a new Issue.
